# Diss_1078399
This repository contains the code and data for Candidate 1078399's Dissertation for the MSc Modelling for Global Health.

The Data inputs can be found in the Submission Data File; code can be found in the Submission Code file. The 'Master File.R' is produces the main outputs, whereas the others produce data inputs needed, including VSL, and monetised DALYs (named appropriately).

When running the code, please check where data are being pulled from and being saved. When this code was run locally, it was set up so that data and outputs were put in different folders for easier navigation purposes.
